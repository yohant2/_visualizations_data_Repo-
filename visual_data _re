My report is based on the course book Data Feminism by Freeman & Ross.
The primary and secondary data visualization are from chapter six and seven.
The [primary data visualization](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3) is about the global shipping routes and the secondary visualization is about
race mental health problem in jail and link for [secondary data visualization](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/czq9dfs5/release/3) .
The information about the primary data visualization is about shipping container and trade among
different countries around the world but not what the shipping container contains. ![The data looks like this](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6Im02eGU5dDFpLzAxNTgzODg3Njg1OTI1LmpwZWciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjE2MDAsImZpdCI6Imluc2lkZSIsIndpdGhvdXRFbmxhcmdlbWVudCI6dHJ1ZX19fQ==)


The second primary data visualization is also based on the course book and the focus of that Data
is about race mental health in jail. colored people in jail is less likely to get mental health problem.
This data from 2011 to 2013 and about 25% of white people in jail were sick mental and about 17% were
black people. Hispanic and other race less than 10%. ![The data looks like this](https://resize-v3.pubpub.org/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhc3NldHMucHVicHViLm9yZyIsImtleSI6ImNtZHZuN2tjLzYxNTg0MzgwNDI5MjI3LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTYwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfX19)

 "Based on book, data feminism is a way of thinking about data,
both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience,
by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought" :fire:
This chapter describes about the discrimination based on people race and gender and
underestimating women on the technology. Women are treated differently especially women
color. How people are discriminated based on their gender and race which is explained on this
chapter using visualized datas. [^1]
